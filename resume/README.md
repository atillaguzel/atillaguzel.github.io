# [Atilla Guzel - Online Resume](https://atillaguzel.github.io/resume/)

I decided to add an online resume to my personal website. This online resume published is based on [Start Bootstrap](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-resume/) theme. I edited the html and CSS files to match the design of homepage, tried to make it as clean and simple as possible.
